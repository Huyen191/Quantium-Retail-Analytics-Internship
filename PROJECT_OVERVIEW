# Project Overview & Business Problems Solved

## Client: Julia – Category Manager, Chips (Australian supermarket chain)

### Task 1 – Customer & Category Understanding
**Business Question**  
"Who is buying chips, how much do they spend, and what drives their purchase behaviour?"

**Problems Solved**  
- No clear view of which customer segments drive chips revenue  
- Unknown brand/pack size preferences across lifestage & affluence  
- Lack of actionable insights for ranging, promotion & loyalty strategy

**My Contribution**  
Delivered customer segmentation revealing:  
• Older Families (Budget) = highest volume  
• Young Singles/Couples (Premium) = highest value (pay 20% more per packet)  
→ Recommendation: Target Premium young customers with high-margin products & loyalty programs

### Task 2 – Store Layout Trial Evaluation
**Business Question**  
"Should we roll out the new planogram layout to all 272 stores?"

**Problems Solved**  
- No scientific way to measure trial store performance  
- Risk of rolling out ineffective layout nationwide (multi-million $ decision)

**My Contribution**  
- Selected statistically matched control stores (77→233, 86→155, 88→237)  
- Proved significant sales uplift in 2/3 trial stores:  
  Store 77: +17.2% (p < 0.01)  
  Store 86: +8.7% (p < 0.05)  
- Identified drivers: increased customer traffic + larger baskets

### Task 3 – Executive Recommendation
**Business Question**  
"What should we tell the client? Yes/No to nationwide rollout?"

**My Final Recommendation to Julia**  
**YES – Roll out the new layout nationwide**  
With phased approach & KPIs: target +9–12% category growth

→ Saved client from potential failed rollout while unlocking millions in incremental revenue
